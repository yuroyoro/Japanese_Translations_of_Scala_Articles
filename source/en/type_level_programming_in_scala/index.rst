Type-Level Programming in Scala
=============================================================

Posted by Mark on June 8, 2010

This series is intended as a guided tour of some type-level programming I have done in Scala. It generally consists of code and examples with a few lines of explanation. It is usually assumed that the reader understands the features of Scalaâ€™s type system. This is not always a good assumption about either the author or the reader of course, so comments and questions are welcome.

The series is in 10 parts, with some parts consisting of more than one post each. The present post will serve as a table of contents linking to the rest of the series, so bookmark this page for easy reference.
